# AI-Storyteller

## Overview
Storyteller is an AI-powered project designed to generate immersive stories, complete with narration and visuals. It utilizes deep learning models for text generation, text-to-speech conversion, and AI-generated images to create engaging multimedia storytelling experiences.

## Features
- **AI-powered story generation** using GPT-2
- **Text-to-speech conversion** with Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)
- **AI-generated images** using Stable Diffusion
- **Video creation** by combining text, images, and narration
- **Customizable prompts** for personalized storytelling
- **Multi-genre support** (fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, etc.)

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rahul0532/storyteller.git
   cd storyteller
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Enter a story prompt**: Provide a seed idea for the AI to generate a story.
2. **Generate text**: The AI model creates a unique narrative based on the prompt.
3. **Convert text to speech**: The generated story is narrated using gTTS.
4. **Generate images**: AI-generated visuals accompany the story.
5. **Create a video**: The text, narration, and images are compiled into a video format.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **PyTorch** (for AI model execution)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (for GPT-2 text generation)
- **gTTS** (Google Text-to-Speech for narration)
- **Stable Diffusion** (for AI-generated images)
- **MoviePy** (for combining text, images, and narration into videos)
- **PIL (Pillow)** (for image processing)
- **Regex (re module)** (for text formatting)
- **Any additional dependencies** listed in `requirements.txt`
